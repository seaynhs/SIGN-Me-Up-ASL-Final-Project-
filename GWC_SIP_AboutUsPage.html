    <h2>Audrey Roemer</h2>
    <img src="oops.png" alt="Audrey Roemer Picture">
    <p>Audrey Roemer is a rising Junior homeschooled student. She spends <br>
      most of her days playing with her 3 cats, and reading fantasy books, <br>
      and dancing! In doing this program, she is hoping to learn more about <br>
      coding and computer hardware with the goal of having fun with it. She is a <br>
      major Trekkie and horror genre fan, with favorites being the Conjuring, <br>
      Blair Witch Project, and Evil Dead. She hopes to die of asphyxiation due to<br>
      her chubby, adorable cats sleeping on her face.</p>

    <h2>Chelsea Yuan</h2>
    <img id = "cy" src="ChelseaYuanBioPic.png" alt="Chelsea Yuan Picture">
    <p>Chelsea Yuan is a senior at Northview High School, who attended Girls<br>
      Who Code because she believed that coding would be an important skill to <br>
      learn before pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in engineering, although she neither likes<br>
      engineering nor wants to be stuck in the American education system. <br>
      She hopes to become powerful and successful in the future but is currently walking<br>
      on a very narrow and very unfortunate path to self-destruction. She fully sees <br>
      herself becoming an alcoholic by middle age and wishes to be immortal. Her ideal <br>
      way to die would be being torn apart by a black hole in the empty void of space.  </p>

    <h2>Kyra Jarvis</h2>
    <img id="kj" src="kyrajarvis.jpg" alt="Kyra Jarvis Picture">
    <p>Sixteen year old Kyra Jarvis has aspirations to be a great artist, <br>
      but a mediocre one isn't such a bad thought. <br>
      She spends most of her time reading and drawing elaborate stories of many characters.<br>
      She joined Girls Who Code in the summer of 2019 with the hopes of maybe learning something useful in the future, <br>
      but quickly realized coding is absolutely not her specialty and will continue to stick with the arts. <br>
      Example of her work in the background of this website! <br>
      If you are interested in her other works you can explore her Instagram @CasimirJarvis.</p>

    <h2>Morgan Burch</h2>
    <img src="MorganBurchBioPic.png" alt="Morgan Burch Picture">
    <p>Morgan Burch is seventeen year old Atlanta resident who helped create this project <br>
      because of her passion for technology, new languages, and the importance of accessibility. <br>
      For god knows what reason, despite having a background in film, television, and voice over, <br>
      Morgan plans to major in computer science. <br>
      This may be because her preferred way to be taken out of this world is to be murdered by a <br>
      robot of her own creation during the inevitable machine uprising.</p>
